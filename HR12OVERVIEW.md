# HR12 — Overview

## Title
Energy, Cost, and Entropy Accounting in QFM

## Abstract (Extended)
This document contributes to the security-native and audit-native
execution layer of the Quansistor Field Computing stack.

It formalizes deterministic execution, replayability, interference-based
control, and intrinsic enforcement mechanisms as first-class computational
semantics.

No exploitative, performance, or hardware-specific claims are made.

## Keywords
QFC, QFM, QVM, TFC, SMRK-Hamiltonian, operator-based computation

## Relation to the QFC Stack
This work integrates with QVM, SMRK, QWASM, and Quansistor Field Mathematics,
forming the governance and verification backbone of the stack.

## Intended Use
Research reference, formal architecture design, security analysis,
audit and compliance frameworks.
